# Part 2 populations at t

Only methods with status pass at t enter a population. LLM method identities include record, round, technique, test class and method; repeated method names across rounds remain distinct. Counts are not deduplicated across records. Technique cells show method counts and their share of that record’s final LLM population.

Totals: full dev 703, dev-own 95, LLM 1466. LLM technique counts: {'ZSL': 247, 'FSL': 270, 'CoT': 293, 'ToT': 311, 'GToT': 345}.

## Developer subset

dev-own matches exactly <CUT package>.<CUT simple name>Test within tests.relevant and filters the existing passing dev methods. The full D_r remains the generation target. No additional developer test compilation or execution was performed.

- Lang-6 and Lang-17 have no matching test class: D_r_own = 0 and dev-own survival is N/A.
- Lang-28 has the matching class, but its only test fails at t: D_r_own = 0 and dev-own survival is N/A. Full-dev reporting remains unchanged.
- Lang-57: D_r = D_r_own = 0; developer survival is N/A at every time point, with note "all developer methods are trigger tests; no developer baseline at t".

The machine-readable population manifest retains population = dev and an own_class boolean. Step 6 must carry own_class into p2-survival-methods.csv. dev-own is a filtered view, not duplicated CSV rows.

## Lang-57 observation and later aggregation

139 LLM methods passed at the buggy version where every developer method fails.

Lang-57 remains in the experiment and its LLM survival is computed normally. Exclude Lang-57 from class-level 2x2 counts and footnote the exclusion. The dev-own 2x2 also omits empty baselines (Lang-6, Lang-17, Lang-28 and Lang-57), reporting them as N/A rather than all-pass.

Every Step 8 table reporting dev must show dev-own beside it: survival by time point, survival by days, failure kinds, class-level 2x2 and counts matched. Include the Lang-57 observation unchanged in handover-part2-c.
