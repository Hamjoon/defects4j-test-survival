# Defects4J Lang: Survival of LLM-Generated Tests vs Developer Tests

This week the survival experiment moved from zod to the Defects4J dataset of the prompting-techniques paper (Ouédraogo et al., EMSE 2026). Its generation pipeline was rebuilt with a different model, and the number of LLM tests was raised to the number of developer tests before measuring survival. Date: 2026-10-03.

## 1. Questions

1. When the LLM test count is raised to the developer test count, how many tests of each kind still pass, unchanged, at later versions of the code?
2. At the version that fixes the bug, which LLM tests fail, and why?

## 2. Setup

- **Subject:** the 14 Lang records of the paper's Defects4J dataset (9 classes). t = the buggy version of each record. Later points: the record's own fixed version, then every dataset Lang bug version dated after t (1 to 14 points per record; 105 record/point pairs, 60 with the class present. The five Lang 2.x records lose their class at the first Lang 3.x point, where the package moved from `lang` to `lang3`).
- **Generation:** the paper's five prompts (ZSL, FSL, CoT, ToT, GToT), each given the class source as in the paper; `gpt-oss-120b` via OpenRouter, temperature 0.7 (the paper's four models are no longer served). The paper's pipeline (extract, compile, run, JaCoCo) is followed; only its extraction step was replaced, because the released reimplementation rejected fenced code and mistook generics for HTML. Generation was repeated per record until the LLM methods passing at t reached the developer methods passing at t; methods with an identical body were counted once.
- **Developer tests:** the Defects4J `tests.relevant` classes of each bug (49 classes), source frozen at t. Unit: the test method. Survival = passes unchanged at a later point. Methods that fail at t (the Defects4J trigger tests) are excluded from both baselines.

## 3. Results

**Table 1. Populations at t and the outcome at the fixed version.**

| Record / class | Developer methods | LLM methods (identical bodies removed) | Generations per prompt | LLM failing at fixed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Lang-4 LookupTranslator | 136 | 141 (2) | 3 | 6 |
| Lang-5 LocaleUtils | 12 | 100 (30) | 1 | 0 |
| Lang-6 CharSequenceTranslator | 141 | 180 (1) | 4 | 3 |
| Lang-11 RandomStringUtils | 10 | 92 (12) | 1 | 0 |
| Lang-12 RandomStringUtils | 8 | 81 (6) | 1 | 0 |
| Lang-13 SerializationUtils | 207 | 230 (53) | 6 | 0 |
| Lang-17 CharSequenceTranslator | 44 | 49 (0) | 1 | 1 |
| Lang-19 NumericEntityUnescaper | 30 | 53 (0) | 1 | 10 |
| Lang-28 NumericEntityUnescaper | 19 | 61 (0) | 1 | 1 |
| Lang-43 ExtendedMessageFormat | 6 | 38 (0) | 1 | 0 |
| Lang-54 LocaleUtils | 11 | 62 (14) | 1 | 0 |
| Lang-55 StopWatch | 5 | 65 (1) | 1 | 1 |
| Lang-57 LocaleUtils | 0* | 104 (35) | 1 | 0 |
| Lang-64 ValuedEnum | 74 | 97 (2) | 3 | 0 |
| **All** | **703** | **1,353 (156)** | | **22** |

\* Lang-57: all 11 developer methods fail at t (the bug is in static initialisation reached from `setUp`), so the record has no developer baseline. Developer methods failing at the fixed version: 0 of 703.

**Table 2. Survival by days after t** (method × time point; absent points excluded from the denominator).

| Days after t | Dev pass / present | Dev compile-fail | Dev assertion fail | LLM pass / present | LLM compile-fail | LLM assertion fail, error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 (fixed version) | 703 / 703 (100.0%) | 0 | 0 | 1,331 / 1,353 (98.4%) | 0 | 22 |
| 1 to 30 | 38 / 38 (100.0%) | 0 | 0 | 125 / 134 (93.3%) | 0 | 9 |
| 31 to 180 | 838 / 879 (95.3%) | 41 | 0 | 1,553 / 1,560 (99.6%) | 0 | 7 |
| 181 to 365 | 639 / 746 (85.7%) | 97 | 6 | 1,179 / 1,209 (97.5%) | 0 | 30 |
| 366 to 730 | 504 / 540 (93.3%) | 28 | 6 | 1,009 / 1,072 (94.1%) | 0 | 63 |
| 731 and later | 90 / 131 (68.7%) | 41 | 0 | 256 / 280 (91.4%) | 0 | 24 |

Developer rows at 181 to 730 days also contain 6 methods not run (inherited methods missing from the JUnit listing). Points beyond 365 days exist for few records.

## 4. Observations

1. **At the fixed version, developer tests do not fail and 22 LLM tests do; all 22 execute lines changed by the fix.** By their failure messages, 19 of the 22 assert the behaviour the fix removed: nine Lang-19 tests expect the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` that the fix removes, six Lang-4 tests assert that a non-String key does not match, and four Lang-6 and Lang-28 tests assert the old handling of surrogate pairs. Of the other three, one is a timing test (`Thread.sleep`) that passes when rerun, one errors with an index exception in the fixed code, and one asserts a consumed-character count. These methods keep failing at every later point; the only LLM failures that appear later are 8 further Lang-28 methods, in the same unescaper class, about a year after t.
2. **The two populations fail in different ways, which follows from their scope.** Developer failures at later versions are compile failures: 207 method/point rows, all "cannot find symbol", from three test classes of other classes whose API changed (two exception test classes of Lang-13, the enum test class of Lang-64), plus one assertion method (`TypeUtilsTest.testIsAssignable`). LLM tests never fail to compile; every LLM failure is an assertion failure or an exception. The LLM tests reference only the class the prompt passed; the developer relevant tests reference the project.
3. **Raising the LLM count to the developer count took little:** after one generation per prompt, 10 of 14 records already exceeded the developer count, and the other four reached it after 2 to 5 further generations. 156 of 1,509 passing LLM methods (10.3%) had a body identical to an earlier one and were removed.

## 5. Limitations

- The model differs from the paper's; only the paper's pipeline is reproduced, not its numbers. Variation between generation runs was not measured.
- 14 records of one project; 45 of 105 record/point pairs are unmeasurable after the package move. The public API of the nine classes did not change within the measured points, which contributes to the LLM compile-failure count of zero.
- "Executes a changed line" is a coverage rule, not proof that the fix caused the failure; these classes are small, so most tests execute the changed lines. Duplicate removal matched identical bodies only; whether differently worded tests check different behaviour was not measured.
